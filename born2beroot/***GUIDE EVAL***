GUIDE TO EVALUATION
It consists of configuring a server, you must install the minimum number of services. For this reason, a graphical interface is pointless.
It is forbidden to install X.org or any equivalent graphical server. Install the latest stable version of Debian/OS.

GENERATE SIGNATURE
sha1sum Born2beroot.vdi

COMPARE SIGNATURE: yours WITH theirs
diff 'EVALUATOR SIGNATURE PATH' 'STUDENT SIGNATURE PATH' >> if nothing returned, then is OK.
Or just check visually both signature.txt

WHAT IS VIRTUAL MACHINE
It is a program that simulates a machine to which an OS is installed, with the advantage that it can be exported, duplicated, deleted...
Debian is focused to a more basic environment and Rocky to a professional one.

WHY DEBIAN/ROCKY?
Debian is an independent distribution with more flexibility, freedom of choice and a large and active community.
Rocky is a commercial and stable distribution, compatible with RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) and with enterprise support.
Run for testing or for production different machines and OS and so for example run Linux on a machine that has Windows.

WHAT IS APT/APTITUDE/APPARMOR?
Aptitude is an enhanced version of apt. Aptitude is a high-level package manager.
Apt is a lower-level package manager. 
APPArmor is a Linux kernel security module that allows the system administrator to restrict the capabilities of a program.
LVM is a logical volume manager. It provides a method for allocating space on mass storage devices that is more flexible
than conventional partitioning schemes for storing volumes.

GRAPHIC INTERFACE?
ls /usr/bin/*session

CONNECT TO USER WITH THE HELP OF THE TESTED STUDENT. USER MUST NOT BE ROOT
"getent group root id "STUDENT""
"sudo ufw status"

TEST FIREWALL SERVICE UFW
"sudo ufw status"
To                 Action      From
4242               ALLOW     Anywhere
4242 (v6)          ALLOW     Anywhere (v6)"


TEST SSH SERVICE
"sudo service ssh status" >> active (running)
Server listening on 0.0.0.0 port 4242
Server listening on :: port 4242"

TEST DEBIAN OR ROCKY
"uname -v" >> #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Debian 6.1.90-1 (2024-05-03)"

VERIFY STUDENT USER EXISTS IN GROUPS SUDO/USER42
"getent group sudo"
"getent group user42"
OR
"id "your ID""

CREATE USER, NOROOT
"sudo adduser noroot"

MANAGE PASSWORD
Assign a password of your choice, respecting the subject's rules
"nano /etc/pam.d/common-password"
minlen=10 ➤ The minimum number of characters the password must contain.
RULES
ucredit=-1 ➤ It must contain at least one capital letter. We put the - as it must contain at least one character, if we put + we mean at most those characters.
dcredit=-1 ➤ It must contain at least one digit.
lcredit=-1 ➤ It must contain at least one lowercase letter.
maxrepeat=3 ➤ It cannot have more than 3 times in a row the same character.
reject_username ➤ It cannot contain the user's name.
difok=7 ➤ It must have at least 7 characters that are not part of the old password.
enforce_for_root ➤ We will implement this policy for the root user

CREATE GROUP "EVALUATING" AND ADD NOROOT TO THE GROUP
The evaluated student creates a group called "evaluating" in front of you and assigns it to this user.
"sudo addgroup evaluating"
"sudo adduser name_user evaluating"

CHECK HOSTNAME
Check that the host name of the machine is formatted correctly as follows: login42 (login of the tested student)
"hostname"

MODIFY
Modify this hostname by replacing the login with your own and reboot the machine.
"sudo nano /etc/hostname"
"sudo reboot"

LVM
Logical volume manager, allocates and manages memory of the different partitions of your virtual machine.

CHECK LVM: PARTITIONS
View the partitions of this virtual machine.
"lsblk"
Compare the output with the example provided in the subject.
Note: Newest version of VM is made with 12GB and not with 8GB, partitions respect the equivalences, not exact numbers.

CHECK SUDO
Check that the "sudo" program is installed.
"dpkg -s sudo"
"sudo adduser noroot sudo"

WHAT IS SUDO
Sudo (Super-User Do): program that allows users to execute commands with the privileges of another user, usually the root user.
This means that normal users can perform administrative tasks without having to know the root password.

CHECK SUDO configuring
Check that the folder "/var/log/sudo/" exists and has at least one file. Here the sudo commands are registered.

WITH SU (super User Permission)
"su"
"nano /etc/sudoers.d/sudo_config"
"cd  /var/log/sudo"
"nano sudo_config"
Check the contents of the files in this folder. You should see a history of the commands used with sudo

LIST SUDO CMDS
View list of sudo commands

RULES
show you the implementation of the rules imposed by the subject
"sudo nano sudo_config"

CHECK FOLDER
Check that the folder "/var/log/sudo/" exists and has at least one file. Here the sudo commands are registered

FIREWALL
"dpkg -s ufw"
"sudo service ufw status"
"sudo ufw status numbered"
"sudo ufw allow 8080"
"sudo ufw status numbered"
"sudo ufw delete num_rule" >> DO IT ONE BY ONE!

SSH
SSH (Secure Shell) is a network protocol that allows secure communication between two computers over an unsecured network.
It is commonly used for remote server administration, secure file transfers and encrypted data tunnels.
"sudo service ssh status"

VERIFY SSH
Verify that the SSH service only uses port 4242.
"sudo service ssh status"
"ssh studentID@192.168.56.1 -p 8080" >> YOU SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ENTER HERE/NO PASSWORD
"ssh studentID@192.168.56.1 -p 4242" >> OK!
"ssh studentID@192.168.56.1 -p 4243" >> YOU SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ENTER HERE/NO PASSWORD
"ssh noroot@192.168.56.1 -p 4242" >> OK!
"ssh root@192.168.56.1 -p 4242 >> YOU SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ENTER HERE/NO PASSWORD

SCRIPT
How your script works by showing you the code.
From ROOT "su"
"ls"
"nano monitoring.sh"

CRON
Cron in Linux is a daemon (background process) that runs automatically on a Linux operating system and allows you to schedule
the execution of tasks or scripts at specific time intervals. These tasks can be simple operating system commands, more complex
scripts or even complete applications.
"sudo crontab -u root -e" >> CHANGE THIS */1 * * * * sh /home/STUDENT-ID/monitoring.sh

CRON STOP
"sudo /etc/init.d/cron stop"
"sudo reboot" >> SCRIPT SHOULD START POPING UP AGAIN

"sudo crontab -u root -e"

DONE! CONGRATS!
